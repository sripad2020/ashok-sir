 Data Loading & Preprocessing
    Imports: Uses pandas, plotly, statsmodels, seaborn, and other libraries for analysis and visualization.

    Data Loading: Reads Country Wise Gender.csv and fills missing values with 0.

    Type Conversion: Converts all Male/Female columns to integers for analysis.

2. Time Series Preparation
    Aggregation: Sums male and female counts across all countries per year to create a total population time series.

    Stationarity Check:

    Performs Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check stationarity.

    Applies first differencing if non-stationary (p-value > 0.05).

    Plots the differenced series using Plotly.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Stacked Bar Plot (2019):

    Compares male vs. female populations by country.

    Histogram (2020 Male):

    Distribution of male population counts across countries.

    Pie Chart (Top 5 by 2020 Female):

    Proportions of female populations for top 5 countries.

    Scatter Matrix (Pairplot):

    Relationships between male/female populations (2018–2020).

    Grouped Bar Chart (2020):

    Side-by-side comparison of male vs. female counts by country.

4. Time Series Modeling
    MA Model (Moving Average):

    ARIMA(0,1,1) to capture short-term fluctuations.

    ARMA Model (AutoRegressive Moving Average):

    ARMA(2,2) for combined autoregressive and moving average effects.

    ARIMA Model (Integrated ARMA):

    ARIMA(1,1,1) with differencing for non-stationary data.

    VARMA Model (Vector ARMA):

    Models multivariate series (male and female totals) with VARMAX(1,1).

5. Model Diagnostics
    Parameter Redundancy Check:

    Interactive Plotly bar charts show p-values and coefficients for each model parameter.

    Highlights significant parameters (✅ p < 0.05) vs. redundant ones (⚠️).

    Residual Analysis:

    Plots: Residual time series, histograms, ACF/PACF, Q-Q plots.

    Tests: Jarque-Bera test for normality.

    Checks for white noise (no autocorrelation) in residuals.

6. Forecasting with ARIMA-GARCH
    ARIMA Forecast:

    Predicts future values using the fitted ARIMA(1,1,1) model.

    GARCH Volatility Modeling:

    Models residual volatility with GARCH(1,1).

    Forecasts conditional variance (uncertainty bands).

    Visualization:

    Combines ARIMA forecasts with GARCH volatility bands (95% confidence intervals).

Key Techniques & Outputs
    Stationarity Handling: Differencing for non-stationary data.

    Model Comparison: MA, ARMA, ARIMA, VARMA.

    Interactive Visualization: Plotly for dynamic EDA and diagnostics.

    Volatility Modeling: GARCH to quantify forecast uncertainty.

    Diagnostic Tests: ADF, Jarque-Bera, Ljung-Box (via ACF/PACF).

Purpose
Objective: Analyze gender-wise passenger trends by country and forecast future totals.

Outcome:

    Identifies key patterns (e.g., top countries, gender distributions).

    Validates model fit (residual diagnostics).

    Provides forecasts with uncertainty estimates using ARIMA-GARCH.
