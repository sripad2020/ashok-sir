1. Data Loading & Cleaning
    Imports: Loads necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, plotly, statsmodels, sklearn, arch, etc.) for data analysis, visualization, and time series modeling.

    Data Loading: Reads the CSV file Country Wise Airport.csv.

    Cleaning:

    Strips whitespace from column names.

    Fixes data entry errors (e.g., replaces 57.l with 57.1).

    Converts numeric columns to float (handling errors with coerce).

2. Data Reshaping
    Long Format Conversion:

    Reshapes the data from wide to long format for easier analysis.

    Combines columns like 2014 Delhi (Airport) into rows with columns: Country, Year, Airport, Percentage.

    Missing Values: Drops rows with NaN values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Top Countries: Identifies top 10 countries by average passenger percentage.

    Visualizations:

    Line Plot: Trends of passenger percentages for top countries (2014â€“2020).

    Heatmap: Average passenger distribution across airports and years.

    Sunburst Chart: Hierarchical view of passenger distribution by country and airport (2019).

    Bar Chart: Airport preferences by country (2019).

    Faceted Line Plots: Trends for top airports by country.

    Choropleth Map: Global passenger distribution to Indian airports (2019).

    Animated Scatter Plot: Evolution of airport preferences over time.

4. Time Series Analysis (ARIMA Modeling)
    Data Preparation:

    Extracts time series data for a specific country-airport pair (e.g., United States Of America at Delhi).

    Converts index to datetime with annual frequency (AS-JAN).

    Stationarity Check:

    Uses the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity.

    Plots rolling mean/std to visualize trends.

    Applies differencing/log transformation if non-stationary.

    Model Identification:

    Plots ACF/PACF to determine ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).

    Fits ARIMA model (e.g., ARIMA(1,1,1)).

    Model Diagnostics:

    Checks residuals for white noise using Ljung-Box test.

    Plots ACF/PACF of residuals to validate model fit.

    Forecasting:

    Forecasts 5 future steps and plots results.

5. Alternative Forecasting Models
    SARIMA: Seasonal ARIMA with seasonal order (1,1,1,12).

    Exponential Smoothing: Holt-Winters method with additive trend/seasonality.

    Linear Regression: Uses time as a feature for simple trend projection.

    Comparison:

    Plots forecasts from all models for visual comparison.

    Prints forecasted values for each model.

6. Volatility Modeling (ARIMA-GARCH)
    GARCH Model:

    Models residual volatility using GARCH(1,1).

    Forecasts conditional variance (volatility) for the next 5 steps.

    Visualization:

    Combines ARIMA forecasts with GARCH volatility bands (upper/lower bounds).

    Uses Plotly for interactive plotting with annotations.

7. Output & Reporting
    Forecast Table:

    Displays forecasted values, volatility (std dev), and confidence bounds.

Diagnostic Metrics:

    Summarizes model performance (AIC, BIC, Ljung-Box p-values).

    Key Techniques Used
    Data Wrangling: Reshaping, cleaning, and aggregation.

    Time Series Decomposition: Stationarity checks, differencing.

Modeling:

    ARIMA/SARIMA for trend/seasonality.

    GARCH for volatility clustering.

    Validation: Residual diagnostics (ACF/PACF, Ljung-Box).

    Visualization: Interactive plots with Plotly/Matplotlib.

Purpose
Objective: Analyze passenger traffic patterns at Indian airports by nationality and forecast future trends.

Outcome: Identifies key trends, validates model accuracy, and provides actionable forecasts with uncertainty estimates.
