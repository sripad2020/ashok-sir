1. Data Loading & Initial Visualization
    Imports: Loads essential libraries (pandas, numpy, plotly, statsmodels, arch) for time series analysis.

    Data Preparation:

    Reads General Data 2014-2020.csv and converts the year column to datetime.

    Sets year as the index for time series operations.

    Exploratory Visualization:

    Creates a grid of subplots (7 rows Ã— 4 cols) to visualize all time series in the dataset.

    Highlights the main metric (noftaii) with a dedicated line plot.

2. Data Preprocessing
    Missing Values:

    Prints missing value counts and fills them using forward fill (ffill).

    Stationarity Check:

    Uses the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check stationarity.

    Applies first and second differencing if needed (p-value > 0.05).

3. Model Identification (ARIMA)
    ACF/PACF Analysis:

    Computes autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) with dynamic lag selection.

    Plots ACF/PACF with confidence intervals (using Plotly) to guide ARIMA parameter selection (p, d, q).

    Grid Search for Best ARIMA:

    Evaluates ARIMA models over a range of (p,d,q) values (e.g., p=0-2, d=0-1, q=0-2).

    Selects the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

4. Model Diagnostics
    Residual Analysis:

    Ljung-Box Test: Checks for autocorrelation in residuals (white noise).

    Visualization: Plots residuals (time series and histogram) to validate normality and randomness.

    Model Summary:

    Prints coefficients, p-values, and goodness-of-fit metrics for the best ARIMA model.

5. Forecasting
    ARIMA Forecast:

    Generates a 3-year forecast with 95% confidence intervals.

    Visualizes actual vs. forecasted values with uncertainty bands (Plotly).

    Volatility Modeling (GARCH):

    Fits a GARCH(1,1) model to ARIMA residuals to capture volatility clustering.

    Plots conditional volatility over time.

Key Techniques & Outputs
    Stationarity Handling: Differencing and ADF tests.

    Parameter Selection: ACF/PACF analysis + grid search for optimal ARIMA.

    Diagnostics: Residual checks (Ljung-Box, visual inspection).

    Forecasting: Point forecasts + confidence intervals.

    Volatility: GARCH modeling for risk/uncertainty quantification.

    Purpose
    Objective: Analyze and forecast the main metric (noftaii) using ARIMA-GARCH.

    Outcome:

    Identifies optimal ARIMA parameters.

    Validates model assumptions (residual diagnostics).

    Provides forecasts with volatility estimates for decision-making.
