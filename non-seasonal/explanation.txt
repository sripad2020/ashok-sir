Code Explanation (Step-by-Step)
    Import Libraries

    pandas, numpy: Data manipulation

    plotly.graph_objects, plotly.express: Interactive visualizations

    statsmodels: Time series analysis (ADF test, ARIMA, ACF/PACF plots)

    sklearn.metrics: RMSE calculation for model evaluation

    warnings: Suppress unnecessary warnings

    Load & Preprocess Data

    Load CSV with pd.read_csv() and parse dates.

    Filter Argentina's data and ensure daily frequency (asfreq('D')).

    Initial Data Visualization

    Plot raw confirmed cases using plotly (interactive line chart with markers).

Stationarity Check

    ADF Test: Checks if data is stationary (null hypothesis: non-stationary).

    Rolling Statistics Plot: Visualizes rolling mean and standard deviation.

    Differencing: Applies 1st and 2nd differences to stabilize mean/variance.

    ACF & PACF Plots

    Plots autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) to identify ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).

    ARIMA Model Training

    Splits data into train (80%) and test (20%).

    Fits ARIMA(1,2,1) based on ACF/PACF analysis.

    Prints model summary (coefficients, AIC/BIC, etc.).

    Residual Analysis

    Plots residuals over time and their distribution.

    Ljung-Box Test: Checks if residuals are white noise (p-value > 0.05 indicates no autocorrelation).

    Forecasting

    Forecasts test data and compares with actuals (interactive plot).

    Computes RMSE to evaluate model accuracy.

    Generates a 30-day future forecast with simulated confidence intervals.

    Enhanced Visualization

    Interactive Elements: Hover tooltips, zoom/pan, range sliders.

    Confidence Intervals: Shaded regions around forecasts (simulated).

    Tabular Forecast: Interactive table with dates, forecasts, and bounds.

Approach & Key Improvements
    Interactive Visuals Over Static Plots

    Replaced matplotlib with plotly for zooming, hovering, and dynamic exploration.

    Comprehensive Stationarity Analysis

    Combined statistical tests (ADF) with rolling statistics visuals for clarity.

    Model Diagnostics

    Residual plots + Ljung-Box test to ensure model adequacy.

    User-Friendly Forecasts

    Confidence Intervals: Added shaded regions to show uncertainty.

    Dynamic Tables: Forecast details in an interactive table.

    Professional Styling

    Used plotly_dark template for readability.

    Consistent color schemes and annotations (e.g., RMSE on chart).

    Navigation Features

    Date range selectors to focus on specific periods.

    Mobile-responsive design.

Key Technical Choices
    ARIMA Order (1,2,1): Selected based on ACF/PACF decay patterns after 2nd differencing.

    Differencing: Applied twice to achieve stationarity (ADF test confirmed).

    Simulated Confidence Intervals: For illustration (actual intervals require get_forecast() in statsmodels).

    Outputs Generated
    Interactive time series plots (historical + forecast).

    Stationarity test results (ADF test stats + rolling metrics).

    Model summary (coefficients, performance metrics).

    Residual diagnostics (plots + statistical test).

    30-day forecast with bounds and tabular data.
